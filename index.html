        <p>The life cycle of a project is the time interval between the appearance of a project (project idea) and its full implementation (liquidation of the project).</p>

                <h5><strong>The Importance of Project Life Cycle</strong></h5>
                <p>The project life cycle establishes a structured approach to project implementation. It clearly defines the activities at each project. It also allows everyone to check the processing of the project. Throughout the project life cycle, project managers can monitor the progress of the project at each phase and determine the completion of each phase. The structure, driven by the project life cycle, is easily understood by the team working on the project. Wasted money and resources can be prevented with effective project management, as 57% of unsuccessful projects fail due to communication breakdown. Project life cycle also helps to improve communication and define roles at the organization’s project. In the phases of the project management life cycle, you come up with the idea for a project, define its goals, plan for its execution, and guide it to completion.</p>

                <p><strong>Initiation phase.</strong> At this stage, you figure out the purpose of your project, determine the feasibility of the project and determine the main results of the project. So you get the customer’s idea, discuss the requirements, approve the term of implementation of the project, confirm the cost of the project. After analyzing all the necessary conditions of the project, the project officially starts. </p>

                <p><strong>Planning phase.</strong> You break down a larger project into smaller tasks, build your team, and schedule assignments. Set smaller goals for a larger project, making sure each goal is achievable within a given time frame. You create tasks and monitor the execution progress of them using task tracker. Some of them are: Jira, uTrack, Trello (free), etc. There are some tools that can help you properly define your goals, such as S.M.A.R.T. and C.L.E.A.R. goals. ‘S.M.A.R.T. goals’ is the approach where you can get all the repercussions of the activities/processes with a clear view. ‘C.L.E.A.R. goals’ is the approach where you can define the goals.</p>

                <p><strong>Execution phase.</strong> This phase turns your plan into action. The project manager’s job in this phase of the project management life cycle is to keep work on track, organize team members, manage timelines, and make sure the work is done according to the original plan. Effective project management comes down to keeping track of every aspect of the project and making sure everyone knows what their roles are and what needs to be completed by when. Without organization, no project can succeed. You lead your project using a project management methodology. </p>

                <p><strong>Closure phase.</strong> At this stage you provide final deliverables, release project resources, and determine the success of the project. Just because the major project work is over, that doesn’t mean the project manager’s job is done—there are still important things to do, including evaluating what did and did not work with the project. At this step you analyze the project perfomance and team issues, take lessons from failures into account. </p>

                <p><strong>Waterfall project management methodology</strong> is a sequential, linear process of project management. It consists of several discrete phases. No phase begins until the prior phase is complete, and each phase’s completion is terminal—waterfall management does not allow you to return to a previous phase. The only way to revisit a phase is to start over at phase one. Below are listed the general stages of this methodology. </p>
                <p><strong>Step 1. Requirement gathering and documentation.</strong> In this stage, you should gather comprehensive information about what this project requires. By the end of this phase, the project requirements should be clear, and you should have a requirements document that has been distributed to your team.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2. System design.</strong> Using the established requirements, your team designs the system. No coding takes place during this phase, but the team establishes specs such as programming language or hardware requirements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p><strong>Step 3. Implementation.</strong> Programmers take information from the previous stage and create a functional product. They typically implement code in small pieces, which are integrated at the end of this phase or the beginning of the next.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 4. Testing.</strong> Testers methodically find and report any problems. If serious issues arise, your project may need to return to phase one for reevaluation.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 5. Delivery/deployment.</strong> In this phase, the product is complete, and your team submits the deliverables to be deployed or released.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 6. Maintenance.</strong> The product has been delivered to the client and is being used. As issues arise, your team may need to create patches and updates may to address them. Again, big issues may necessitate a return to phase one.</p>

                <p><strong>Agile project management methodology</strong> rejects sequential phases and relies on simultaneous, incremental work across various departments. Teams complete work in sprints, which are typically broken out into two-week chunks of time. Various checkpoints throughout the project allow the team to change direction as needed. By continually taking the temperature of the project throughout the process, you can deliver a better final product.</p>
                <p><strong>12 principles from the Agile Manifesto:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Frequent delivery of working software
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Support, trust, and motivate the people involved
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enable face-to-face interactions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working software is the primary measure of progress
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Agile processes to support a consistent development pace
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simplicity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Regular reflections on how to become more effective
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These 12 principles are informed by four main values in Agile. Those <strong>four Agile values</strong> are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working software over comprehensive documentation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Responding to change over following a plan
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are many types of Agile frameworks to choose from for development and project management. Some of them are: scrum, kanban, scrumban, extreme programming, etc.</p>
